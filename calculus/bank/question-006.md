- [ ] $f$ has neither local maxima nor local minima.
- [x] $\sqrt{2}$ is a local minimum.
- [ ] $\sqrt{2}$ is a local maximum.
- [x] $-\sqrt{2}$ is a local maximum.
- [ ] $-\sqrt{2}$ is a local minimum.
- [x] $f$ has two critical points.

We have:

$$
f( x) =x^{3} -6x
$$

The first and second derivatives are:

$$
f^{\prime }( x) =3x^{2} -6,\ f^{\prime \prime} ( x) =6x
$$

The critical points of $\displaystyle f$ are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
3x^{2} -6 & =0\\
x^{2} & =2\\
x & =\pm \sqrt{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

We have two critical points. Now for the determination of the nature of the optimum:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f^{\prime \prime} \left(\sqrt{2}\right) &  >0\\
f^{\prime \prime} \left( -\sqrt{2}\right) & < 0
\end{aligned}
$$

$\displaystyle \sqrt{2}$ is a local minimum and $\displaystyle -\sqrt{2}$ is a local maximum.
