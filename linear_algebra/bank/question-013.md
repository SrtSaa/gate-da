- [ ] $A$ has orthogonal columns which are not necessarily orthonormal.

- [ ] $Ax = b$ has a unique solution.
- [ ] $Ax = b$ has no solutions.
- [ ] $Ax = b$ has infinitely many solutions.

- [ ] $A$ has orthogonal columns which are not necessarily orthonormal.
- [x] $A$ has orthonormal columns.
- [x] $Ax = b$ has a unique solution.
- [ ] $Ax = b$ has no solutions.
- [ ] $Ax = b$ has infinitely many solutions.

An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is orthogonal if its columns are orthonormal. It follows that the columns of $A$ are linearly independent. This implies that $A$ is invertible and $Ax = b$ has a unique solution. It is to be noted that the columns have to be orthonormal and not just orthogonal.
