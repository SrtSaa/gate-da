**Assertion**: If $A^2 + A = I$, then $A^{-1} = A + I$

**Reason**: If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, $B$ is an $n \times p$ matrix, with $AB = I$, then $A^{-1} = B$

- [ ] Assertion is true and Reason is true. Reason is the correct explanation for Assertion.
- [ ] Assertion is true and Reason is true. Reason is not the correct explanation for Assertion.
- [ ] Both Assertion and Reason are false.
- [ ] Assertion is true. Reason is False.
- [ ] Assertion is false. Reason is true.

$A^2 + A = I \implies A(A + I) = I$. Since $A$ is a square matrix, $AB = I \implies B = A^{-1}$. So the Assertion is true. The Reason is however a false statement. It is true only if $A$ and $B$ are square matrices. In its current form $A$ and $B$ are not necessarily square.
