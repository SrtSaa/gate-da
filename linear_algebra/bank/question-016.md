$\displaystyle x$ and $\displaystyle y$ are vectors in $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{n}$. If $\displaystyle x-y$ is orthogonal to $\displaystyle x+y$, comment on the relationship between $\displaystyle ||x||$ and $\displaystyle ||y||$.

- [ ] $||x|| = ||y||$
- [ ] $||x|| > ||y||$
- [ ] $||x|| < ||y||$
- [ ] There is no relationship between the norms of these two vectors.

Expand the dot product of $x - y$ and $x + y$.

- [x] $||x|| = ||y||$
- [ ] $||x|| > ||y||$
- [ ] $||x|| < ||y||$
- [ ] There is no relationship between the norms of these two vectors.

If $\displaystyle x-y$ and $\displaystyle x+y$ are orthogonal, then we have $\displaystyle \langle x-y,x+y\rangle =0$. From this we get $\displaystyle \langle x,x\rangle =\langle y,y\rangle \Longrightarrow ||x||=||y||$.
