Choose the correct set of options.

- [ ] If two matrices $A$ and $B$ have the same reduced row echelon form, then $A$ must be equal to $B$.

- [ ] If two matrices $A$ and $B$ have the same row echelon form, then $A$ must be equal to $B$.

- [ ] The reduced row echelon form of a diagonal matrix with non-zero diagonal entries must be the identity matrix.

- [ ] The reduced row echelon form of a non-zero scalar matrix must be the identity matrix.

- Option-(a) is incorrect. As a counter example, consider any two invertible matrices of the same order that are distinct from each other. Both have the same reduced row echelon form, namely the identity matrix.



- Option-(b) is incorrect. An argument similar to the previous bullet point can be applied here.



- Option-(c) is correct. In fact, as stated in the first point, any invertible matrix has the identity matrix as its reduced row echelon form. Since a diagonal matrix with non-zero diagonal entries is invertible, the result follows.



- Option-(d) is correct. A non-zero scalar matrix is an example of a diagonal matrix with non-zero diagonal entries.
