Let $M_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R})$ represent the set of all $2 \times 2$ real matrices. Now consider the following sets:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    V_1 &= \{A\ |\ A \in M_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R}) \text{ and } A \text{ is a diagonal matrix}\}\\
    V_2 &= \{A\ |\ A \in M_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R}) \text{ and sum of diagonal elements of } A \text{ is equal to 1}\}
\end{aligned}
$$
Which of the following statements is true?

- [ ] $V_1$ is a subspace of $M_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R})$, but $V_2$ is not

- [ ] $V_2$ is a subspace of $M_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R})$, but $V_1$ is not

- [ ] Both $V_1$ and $V_2$ are subspaces of $M_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R})$

- [ ] Neither $V_1$ nor $V_2$ are subspaces of $M_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R})$

- [x] $V_1$ is a subspace of $M_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R})$, but $V_2$ is not

- [ ] $V_2$ is a subspace of $M_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R})$, but $V_1$ is not

- [ ] Both $V_1$ and $V_2$ are subspaces of $M_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R})$

- [ ] Neither $V_1$ nor $V_2$ are subspaces of $M_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{R})$

$V_2$ does not have the zero element. $V_1$ has the zero element, is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
