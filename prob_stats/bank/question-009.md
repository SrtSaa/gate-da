 Let $A$ and $B$ be the two events of a random experiment. Probability that at least one of the two events $A$ and $B$ will occur is 0.6. Probabilities of event $A$ occurring and $B$ occurring are 0.3 and 0.4 respectively. Then, find the probability that event $A$ will occur given that event $B$ has occurred.

Use addition rule of probability to calculate $P(A \cap B)$ and then apply the conditional probability formula.

Given, $P(A) = 0.3, P(B) = 0.4$ and $P(A \cup B) = 0.6$  
$P(A \cap B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cup B) = 0.3 + 0.4 - 0.6 = 0.1$  

$P(A | B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \dfrac{0.1}{0.4} =\dfrac{1}{4} = 0.25$.
