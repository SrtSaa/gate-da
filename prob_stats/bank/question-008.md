 $57\%$ students of girls' school wear neither a ring nor a necklace, 
$30\%$ wear a ring, and 
$25\%$ wear a necklace. If one of them is randomly chosen, find the probability that she is wearing a ring and a necklace.

Define event $R$ as "wears a ring" and the event $N$ as "wears a necklace". Given,  

$P(R^c \cap N^c) = P(R \cup N)^c = 0.57 \implies P(R \cup N) = 1 - P(R \cup N)^c = 1-0.57 = 0.43,$ $P(R) = 0.30$ and $P(N) = 0.25$  

$P(R \cup N) = P(R) + P(N) - P(R \cap N)$\vspace{1mm}  

$P(R \cap N) = P(R) + P(N) - P(R \cup N) = 0.30+0.25-0.43 = 0.12$
