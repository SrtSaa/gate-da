 A person has bought a bed from an online furniture store. The seller delivers the disassembled bed parts along with some screws to assemble it. The probability of a screw being defective is 
0.1 independent of all other screws. To compensate for the manufacturing error, the seller sends two extra screws in the package where the bed needs exactly 
8 screws to assemble. What is the probability that the buyer will be able to assemble the bed? (Enter the answer up to 2 decimal accuracy)
