Which of the following option(s) is(are) true?

- [ ]  If events $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$. 
- [ ] If events $A$ and $B$ are independent, then $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$.
- [ ] If events $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$.
- [ ] If events $A$ and $B$ are independent, then $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$.

Two events $A$ and $B$ are disjoint (mutually exclusive) if $A \cap B = \phi$ and $A$ and $B$ are independent events if $P(A | B ) = P(A | B^c) = P(A)$.

Two events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive (disjoint) if $A \cap B = \phi$.
Then, $P(A \cap B) = 0 \implies P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B).$

$P(A  \cap  B) = P(A | B) \times P(B) = P(A) \times P(B)$ because $P(A | B ) = P(A | B^c) = P(A)$ if $A$ and $B$ are independent.
