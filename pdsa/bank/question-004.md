$11$

In a connected planar graph, the relationship between the number of vertices ($n$), edges ($e$), and faces ($r$) is given by Euler's formula:

$r = e - n + 2$

Given that $n = 8$ and $r = 5$:

$5 = e - 8 + 2$

Solving for $e$:

$e = 11$

Therefore, the number of edges in graph G is indeed 11, satisfying Euler's formula for a connected planar graph.
